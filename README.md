# Project: The Ancient Well of Questions

A study helper for students that need practice questions and assistance in memorization. This program is best suited for memorizing definitions.

Running Instructions:
    Run the file "home.py" and follow the link in the terminal starting with "http://". The site will open in a web browser.
    In the upper text box, enter lines of text and click submit.
    
    NOTE: The input must be in complete simple sentences. Compound sentences and complex sentences will result in improper output.
        If entering multiple sentences, each sentence must be typed on a new line.
    
Notes and Assumptions:
    The program runs a site which takes text input and transforms the text into questions which is then output to the site.

    The program assumes that the input will be line separated simple sentences.

Key Files:
    sentence.py: Contains functions that identify sentence structure and transforms sentences into questions
    main.html: Webpage formatting and styling through html and css
    home.py: Links sentence.py and main.html, and runs the site using Flask

Accomplishments:
    Learned to use Flask, HTML, and CSS within a strict time limit.
    Researched grammar and sentence structure.

Future Improvements:
    Improve capability of processing a wider variety of sentences including compound and complex sentences. This will require extensive research on sentence structure.
    Expand on types of questions produced.
    Add features such as selecting question types, automatically checking and revealing solutions to questions, grading capabilities.
